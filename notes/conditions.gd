[b]Conditionals and Booleans[/b]
A conditional is an expression which evaluates to a [b]truthy[/b] or [b]falsy[/b] value.
In short, conditional ni swali kama [i]Am i a boy?[/i], [i]Am I a girl?[/i] au [i]Is my phone an Iphone?[/i]
Hizo maswali zote unaweza zijibu in two ways, either [b][i]ndio[/i][/b] ama [b][i]hapana[/i][/b]. Now that makes the questions conditionals.

What is a boolean? a boolean is a value that is either [b]truthy[/b] or [b]falsy[/b]
  - Truthy values include [code]true[/code] and [code]yes[/code].
  - Falsy values include [code]false[/code] and [code]no[/code].
Most programming languages use [code]true[/code] and [code]false[/code] so tutastick na hizo. Of course kuna other truthy and falsy values lakini kwa sasa tustick na [code]true[/code] and [code]false[/code]. 

When you evaluate a conditional expression, the result is a boolean value. i.e. [code]true[/code] or [code]false[/code].
With this in mind turudi kwa conditional zetu. [i]"Is my phone an Iphone?"[/i]. Limit jibu lako to either [code]true[/code] or [code]false[/code]. Umepata jibu?
Nice, hilo jibu ni a boolean value!
Okay. Sasa tuende into an interactive session. It will basically entail answering simple questions.

[b]Conditionals and Booleans[/b]

What is a conditional? 
 - A conditional is an expression Which evaluates to a truthy or false value. 
- Take for example some basic questions such as 
	   â€“ [i]Am I a boy[/i]? , [i]Am I a girl[/i], [i]Are my feet big?[/i] Or [i]Is my phone an iPhone?[/i]
- These questions can only be answered in two ways, [code]yes[/code] or [code]no[/code]/ [code]true[/code] or [code]false[/code]
This implies that this basic questions are Conditionals .

What is a [b][i]boolean[/i][/b]? 
A boolean is a variable that Can express a single Truthy or Falsy value. 
 One must understand that a 
- Truthy value evaluate to [code]yes[/code] or [code]true[/code] in this context.
- Falsy value evaluate to [code]no[/code] or [code]false[/code] in this context.

Most programming languages use a [code]true[/code] or [code]false[/code] basis, there are, of course other Truthy and Falsy values but for the moment we shall focus on True and False.

From what we have learnt, we see that when we evaluate a Conditional expression the result we get is a Boolean value. i.e  true or false. 
With this in mind, let's return to our conditional and we can answer them, knowing that the answer you give  is a Boolean value.  

Now let's move over to an interactive session to test what we've already learnt.
